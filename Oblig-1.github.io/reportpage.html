        <p>For the preparations we had to think why people visit restaurants 
            pages in the first place. The first thing that came to mind was menu and location. So we thought that the menu should be 
            easily accessible for the user and have pictures so that the costumer knows what the food looks like. Also, ingredients so 
            that if people are allergic they know what kind of food they can order. Further we added a little text about the restaurant
             as a nice welcome to the user. Also we added the location of the restaurant at the bottom of each page so that it was easily 
             accessible. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The changes we made from the first to the second page was mostly some unnecessary code that didnâ€™t do much.
             Most of the changes we did was inn css so that the page looked more welcoming and easier to navigate.
